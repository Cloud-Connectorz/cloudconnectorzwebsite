information: "With the increased complexity of development it’s also necessary to have a much better understanding of how to keep your IT operational and how everything fits together. It was Werner Vogel in 2006 that said: ‘You build it, you run it’. Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that many disciplines have started to interact much more and perform overlapping activities. IT is only successful trough understanding and strong connections."
