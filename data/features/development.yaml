information: "Development has long ceased to be about monolithic applications. Nowadays it is a series of (micro)services, functions, containers, interfaces, services, etc. This type of development requires a different approach. Not only object-oriented, but much more. Development revolves around creativity, analytical skills, continuous learning, passion and fun and interaction with each other."
