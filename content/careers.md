## About the role

---

#### Cloud/DevOps Consultant/Engineer

We are looking for cloud enthusiasts who want to make an impact. Instead of just staffing projects, we closely look at your skills, experience and ambition, and try to match that with a challenging assignment. The projects vary in length between 3 to 18 months. We always help customers with the end in mind: after the project, the client needs to be able to make the next steps.

#### About you

You are passionate about building scalable and reliable cloud platforms and software. In your work, you constantly balance pragmatism and quality. Youâ€™re not a ticket ticker but a builder and a team player. You are able to translate business requirements into practical architecture. You are able to communicate the advantages of the cloud to both business and techies. You focus on the connection.

Next to that, youâ€™re a polyglot developer/scripter and would almost call yourself a programmer ðŸ˜‰. But writing business code is not your key goal, you like to solve problems. There is no challenge to big. You like to automate infrastructures and/or containerize applications and believe in serverless; you like to connect! DevOps, SRE, CCoE, you understand these concepts and know that itâ€™s all about learning, listening, understanding and automation. Itâ€™s about the connection.

#### Good to know

We expect you to be a proactive: you shape your own assignment, you are entrepreneurial and youâ€™re not afraid of new environments. You are curios, constantly learning and a puzzler always looking for solutions. You have been in the Netherlands for more than a year already, so you are familiar with the Dutch culture and way of working.
