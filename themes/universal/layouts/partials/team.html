      <p>Hi, my name is Jorryt de Vries. Founder and co-owner of Cloud Connectorz. I have been working in IT for over 20+ years. I had roles from developer to consultant, project management, coaching, etc. I am result-oriented, pragmatic, analytical and always looking for solutions.</p>
      <p>Over the years it became clear to me that I am always looking for connections. Be it personal or business, this is what drives me and what I am looking for. Connection is also the key in IT and it is from that conviction that I started Cloud Connectorz.</p>
